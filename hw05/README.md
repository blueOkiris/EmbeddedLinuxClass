I may change this later, but at the moment I am unable to edit the project page.

I've mentioned some project ideas in class though:

 1. Building an Android's head

    - Take a rubber halloween mask and put it over a head "skeleton" where the mouth can be moved into a few positions with servos

    - Use speech recognition to create a text stream input

    - Feed it into a chat bot program. I could probably find an open source one online as writing my own could be out of scope unless it's just super barebones like `if(strcmp(voiceInput, "hello") = 0) { say("hello"); }`

    - Use speech synthesis to redirect the chat bot text output to a speaker

    - *Seems* like a lot more work than it actually __would__ be. The chat bot is really the only super complex thing there.

 2. Robot Dog (Fetch Bot)

    - Lot's of things could be here and make it out of scope, so only one should be implemented: playing fetch.

    - "Dog" has a robot body that can move different directions

    - Uses camera and the OpenCV library to do object tracking on a green ball

    - Moves body to search for and move to ball, playing "fetch"
