I added another idea for a project, using the bone as an Arcade Fighting stick.

Essentially you make the bone appear as a USB HID and send controller inputs based on the bone's GPIO which are wired to arcade buttons in a joystick.

One can also place the buttons in a nice wooden enclosure for structure
