## Project

> Create a time line for your project. Select milestones you need to achieve to finish on time.

I think my main milestones would be:

1. Basic Speech Synthesis working

2. Speech Recognition working

3. Servo working

4. Physical Structure built

5. Primitive Brain complete

6. All pieces performing together

7. Advanced Brain

8. Better Speech Synthesis

My timeline was essentially:

- M1 and M2 - Week 7

- M3, M4, M5 - Week 8

- M6 - Week 9

- M7 and M8 - Longterm goals

## Logging in Sheets

> Select a sensor of your choice (the temperature sensor from an earlier homework is a good choice). Write a program to read the sensor and log the results on a Google Sheet

I'm choosing to take speech from a microphone as my project is already attached to one :)

I have a python speech recognition library I can use

The program I've written is `hw09/sheets/miclogger.py`
