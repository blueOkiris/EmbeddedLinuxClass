## Project

> Create a time line for your project. Select milestones you need to achieve to finish on time.

I think my main milestones would be:

1. Basic Speech Synthesis working

2. Speech Recognition working

3. Servo working

4. Physical Structure built

5. Primitive Brain complete

6. All pieces performing together

7. Advanced Brain

8. Better Speech Synthesis

My timeline was essentially:

- M1 and M2 - Week 7

- M3, M4, M5 - Week 8

- M6 - Week 9

- M7 and M8 - Longterm goals

## Logging in Sheets

> Select a sensor of your choice (the temperature sensor from an earlier homework is a good choice). Write a program to read the sensor and log the results on a Google Sheet

I chose a simple button because it's easier to verify the results are correct.

## ThingSpeak

> Repeat the exercise using ThingSpeak
