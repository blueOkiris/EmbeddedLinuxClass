`make TARGET=hello.pru0 stop`

Couldn't get some GPIO to work (P9_31 included), so I'm using P8_12 bc I can consistently get it to work.

My version is in `hw08/pru-examples/02/hell0.pru0.c`

T = 2.96ms

YES. It's a triangle wave.

Mostly. I do see some places where the signal changes, but it's pretty good

Stable

Maybe
